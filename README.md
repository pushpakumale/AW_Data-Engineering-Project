# ⚡ Azure End-to-End Data Engineering Project 

This repository contains a comprehensive end-to-end data engineering pipeline implemented using the Azure ecosystem. The project simulates a real-world data flow—from ingestion to transformation to analytics-ready serving—using enterprise-grade tools and best practices.

### 🔍 Overview

The project is divided into three core phases:

### 🟦 Phase 1: Dynamic Data Ingestion

            Ingest data from various sources (e.g., blob storage, REST APIs, databases) using Azure Data Factory and Azure Logic Apps.
            Schema evolution and metadata handling with Data Lake Storage Gen2.
            Parameterized and reusable pipeline design for flexibility and automation.

### 🔧 Phase 2: Data Transformation using Databricks

            Cleanse and transform raw data using Azure Databricks (Apache Spark).
            Apply business logic and data enrichment.
            Create bronze, silver, and gold layer architecture using Delta Lake for optimized querying and reliability.

### 🔷 Phase 3: Serving with Synapse

            Serve transformed datasets to business users through Azure Synapse Analytics.
            Enable SQL-based reporting and dashboarding using Power BI.
            Leverage Synapse serverless and dedicated pools for optimized performance and cost.
